  abstract = {The need to develop accurate representation of the human eye for the purpose of physiological studies is important to ensure that the predicted results are reliable. The presence of natural circulation of aqueous humor (AH) is evident from clinical, experimental and simulated observations. Most of the thermal models of the human eye that are found in the literature, however, had assumed a stagnant AH inside the anterior chamber. In this paper, a two-dimensional model of the human eye is developed where the circulation of AH inside the anterior chamber is included. The effects of the AH flow on the temperature distribution inside the eye are investigated. The natural circulation of AH is found to increase the temperature and distorts the temperature profile in the cornea and anterior chamber. Further investigations, where an artificial heat source is introduced inside the human eye suggest that AH flow plays a role in the heat transfer at the anterior region of the eye although this has yet to be quantified experimentally.}

  abstract = {Abstract Computational modeling is an effective tool for the detection of eye abnormalities and a valuable assistant to hyperthermia treatments. In all these diagnoses and treatments, predicting the temperature distribution accurately is very important. However, the standard finite element method (FEM) currently used for such purposes has strong reliance on element meshes and the discretized system exhibits the so-called ‘overly stiff’ behavior. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper formulates an alpha finite element method ($\alpha$FEM) to compute two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) bioheat transfer in the human eyes. The $\alpha$FEM can produce much more accurate results using triangular (2D) and tetrahedron (3D) elements that can be generated automatically for complicated domains and hence is particularly suited for modeling human eyes. In the $\alpha$FEM, a scaling factor $\alpha$∈[0, 1] is introduced to combine the ‘overly stiff’ FEM model and ‘overly soft’ node-based finite element method (NS-FEM) model. With a properly chosen $\alpha$, the $\alpha$FEM can produce models with very ‘close-to-exact’ stiffness of the continuous system. Numerical results have shown that the present method gives much more accurate results compared with the standard FEM and the NS-FEM. Copyright 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This work is an extension from an earlier published work on the 2D model. In this paper, a 3D FEM model of the human eye is simulated for the steady state temperature distribution during normal condition and during electromagnetic (EM) wave radiation. Results show a discrepancy of 0.49\% for a normal condition as opposed to 1.9\% of a 2D model when compared to experimental results from open literatures. Investigations on the EM wave radiations found an average power absorption density of 15,151 and 22,145Wm-3 for the 750 and 1500MHz radiation, respectively. A peak temperature of 38.18°C was predicted for the 750MHz radiation while 41.19°C was computed for the 1500MHz radiation. These temperatures are in reasonable agreement with the simulated results computed by another report in the past.}

The normal steady state temperature distributions in human and rabbit eyes are given. The model has been experimentally fitted to data obtained from measurements on rabbit eyes. The heat transfer from the choroid to the body core temperature of the rabbit is described by the heat transfer coefficient hs=65 W m-2 degrees C-1, and from the cornea to the surrounding air temperature by hc=20W m-2 degrees C-1. The thermal conductivity and the specific heat of the lens of the rabbit eye were determined empirically to be 0.40 W m-1 degrees C-1 and 3.0 J g-1 degrees C-1 respectively. The thermal properties of the vitreous humour were taken to be equal to the thermal properties of water.}

The intraocular temperature distribution is calculated using the Galerkin finite element method. A difficulty associated with the development of an accurate model of the human eye is the lack of reliable biological data available on the constants and parameters that are used in the model. These parameters include the thermal conductivities of the ocular tissues, the heat loss from the anterior corneal surface to the surroundings by convection and evaporation, and the convective heat loss from the sclera to the body core. The different values for the parameters reported in the ophthalmic literature are employed in the model, and the sensitivity of the temperature distribution to uncertainties in the parameters is investigated. A set of control parameter values is suggested for the normal human eye. The effect of the ambient temperature and the body-core temperature on the temperature distribution in the human eye is considered.}

Successful thermal modeling of the human eye will assist in enabling early detections of eye abnormalities such as inflammatory. However, validity of every computer simulated results must be benchmarked with experimental measurement and this can be a daunting task especially in biomedical fields where experimental data is not in abundance. This paper presents a 2D finite element (FE) human eye model developed to simulate its thermal steady state conditions based on the properties and parameters reported in the open literatures. The results are verified with experimental and computational results obtained by previous studies on human as well as animal eyes. Results show discrepancy of only 0.33\% when compared to images from infrared (IR) screening and a difference of only 0.127\% compared to another finite element model. The sensitivity analysis also provides good agreement with results by previous studies. This promising simulation allows new possibility in computational methods for eye health care.}

  abstract = {There are a lot of geometrical and morphological changes that happen in the human eye with age. Primary open-angle glaucoma, which is caused by the increase in intraocular pressure inside the anterior chamber of the eye is also associated with the physiological aging of the eye. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effects of aging on drug delivery in the human eye when applied topically. Consequently, a numerical model of topical drug delivery for an aging human eye has been developed using commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics in the current study. Three different age groups (young, middle and old) have been considered and the changes in geometrical and tissue properties of different domains of the eye with age have been included in the numerical model. The effect of aging on heat transfer, aqueous humor flow, intraocular pressure and drug concentration in different domains and orientations of the eye have been investigated. Additionally, an attempt has been made to predict the best class of anti-glaucomatic treatment in silico that should be preferred to treat primary open-angle glaucoma effectively. Results illustrate that there is a decrease in the average corneal temperature and an increase in the temperature deviation across the cornea with age. Further, there is a decrease in the aqueous humor flow magnitude in the anterior chamber of the eye and an increase in intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber of older age groups, which leads to primary open-angle glaucoma. The reduced aqueous humor flow leads to increased drug concentration in the anterior chamber as well as iris and reduced drug concentration in the trabecular mesh of the older age groups, thereby affecting the treatment efficacy. Additionally, our simulated results demonstrate that anti-glaucomatic treatments should be more focused on treating the trabecular mesh rather than the ciliary body of the eye.}

The results obtained from a mathematical model were compared with the data obtained from the needle and fine wire temperature probes placed in the rabbit eye. The comparison suggests that intraocular temperature measurements are in error due to heat conduction losses from the probe and trauma to the eye. The errors are smaller for probes of fine wire than for needle-type probes. Results from the mathematical model can be used to predict intraocular temperatures in rabbits and humans for various air temperatures and wind velocities.}

  title    = {Ocular surface temperature: a review},
  author   = {Purslow, Christine and Wolffsohn, James S},
  abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the evolution in ocular temperature
              measurement during the last century and examine the advantages
              and applications of the latest noncontact techniques. The
              characteristics and source of ocular surface temperature are also
              discussed. METHODS: The literature was reviewed with regard to
              progress in human thermometry techniques, the parallel
              development in ocular temperature measurement, the current use of
              infrared imaging, and the applications of ocular thermography.
              RESULTS: It is widely acknowledged that the ability to measure
              ocular temperature accurately will increase the understanding of
              ocular physiology. There is a characteristic thermal profile
              across the anterior eye, in which the central area appears
              coolest. Ocular surface temperature is affected by many factors,
              including inflammation. In thermometry of the human eye, contact
              techniques have largely been superseded by infrared imaging,
              providing a noninvasive and potentially more accurate method of
              temperature measurement. Ocular thermography requires high
              resolution and frame rate: features found in the latest
              generation of cameras. Applications have included dry eye,
              contact lens wear, corneal sensitivity, and refractive surgery.
              CONCLUSIONS: Interest in the temperature of the eye spans almost
              130 years. It has been an area of research largely driven by
              prevailing technology. Current instrumentation offers the
              potential to measure ocular surface temperature with more
              accuracy, resolution, and speed than previously possible. The use
              of dynamic ocular thermography offers great opportunities for
              monitoring the temperature of the anterior eye.},

               mechanisms behind the onset and progression of these
               heterogenous diseases. The eye represents a unique window to the
               brain that can be easily assessed via non-invasive ocular
               imaging. As such, ocular measurements have been recently
               considered as potential sources of biomarkers for the early
               detection and management of NDD. However, the current use of
               ocular biomarkers in the clinical management of NDD patients is
               particularly challenging. Specifically, many ocular biomarkers
               are influenced by local and systemic factors that exhibit
               significant variation among individuals. In addition, there is a
               lack of methodology available for interpreting the outcomes of

  abstract = {{We present a technique for the rapid and reliable prediction of linear-functional outputs of elliptic (and parabolic) partial differential equations with affine parameter dependence. The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations—Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation—relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp and rigorous bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control. }},

Elevated intraocular pressure will affect the normal aqueous humor outflow, resulting in deformation of iris. However, the deformation ability of iris is closely related to its material properties. Meanwhile, the passive deformation of the iris aggravates the pupillary block and angle closure. The nature of the interaction mechanism of iris deformation and aqueous humor fluid flow has not been fully understood and has been somewhat a controversial issue. The purpose here was to study the effect of IOP, localization, and temperature on the flow of the aqueous humor and the deformation of iris interacted by aqueous humor fluid flow.},

  abstract = {This contribution was dedicated to the assessment of the electromagnetic (EM) distributions inside a 3D modeled human eye. Since the use of accurate and efficient electromagnetic tools is crucial to obtain such results, an original hybrid boundary element method (BEM)/finite element method (FEM) is presented through the example of an EM wave impinging on the eye corneal region. Due to the variability inherent to the characterizing of living parameters (regarding our frequency range of interest about a few GHz), an accurate modeling of those mostly electrical data is necessary. A simple formalism based upon a “philosophy” close to Monte Carlo requirements is proposed in this paper in order to integrate efficiently and precisely uncertainties in the proposed results. The analysis of the sensitivity of different electrical parameters aims to increase a better knowledge of the EM fields distribution inside an eye. Obviously, both the deterministic EM modeling and the stochastic theoretical basis will be presented. The whole model will be illustrated on numerical examples including different random variables.}

  abstract = {This paper deals with uncertainty quantification of transcranial electric stimulation (TES) of realistic human head model. The head model taken from Visible Human Project consists of 9 subdomains: scalp, skull, CSF, grey matter, white matter, cerebellum, ventricles, jaw and tongue. The deterministic computation of quasi-static induced electric scalar potential features boundary element method (BEM). Conductivities of each subdomain are modelled as uniformly distributed random variables and stochastic analysis features a non-intrusive stochastic collocation method (SCM). The input uncertainties impact only the magnitude of the electric scalar potential and not the position of the potential extrema. Skin and brain conductivities play the most important role, while CSF conductivity has negligible impact on the output potential variance. The significance of the skull conductivity is not high for the chosen input parameter setup. In the previous work authors considered 3-compartment head model which consisted of scalp, skull and brain compartments. The presented model is a step forward in SCM+BEM TES analysis, primarily in terms of model complexity. Comparing the results of the two analyses it can be concluded that the uncertainty in the added tissues’ conductivities do not impact the variation of the output electric potential.}
