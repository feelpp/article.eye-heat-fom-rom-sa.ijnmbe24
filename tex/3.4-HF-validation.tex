\subsubsection{Mesh convergence}
\label{sec:verify:mesh-convergence}


In \Cref{sec:model-geo}, we detailed the geometry of the eyeball, derived from computer-aided design (CAD) data.
As illustrated in \Cref{fig:geo-eye}, certain regions exhibit greater complexity than others.
For instance, the lamina cribrosa is notably thinner, while the iris presents a less uniform structure.
Achieving an effective mesh requires a well-distributed arrangement of elements.
This is attainable through the application of a specialized meshing algorithm designed to tailor the mesh according to the geometric intricacies.
Utilizing the MMG library \cite{mmg}, we have generated a family of meshes with varying levels of refinement.
These meshes are used to our subsequent simulation processes.


\Cref{tab:mesh} displays the characteristics of the meshes, such as their characteristic size $h$ and the number of degrees of freedom (nDof) for both $\P_1$ and $\P_2$ finite element discretizations.

In this section, we detail the outcomes of our mesh convergence analysis.
This analysis involves solving the given problem across various mesh configurations and subsequently comparing the resultant data.
To conduct this study, we first solve the model denoted as  $\Em_\text{NL}(\bar{\mu})$.
Following this, we compute the output $T^\fem_{\text{NL}, O}$ representing the temperature at the cornea's center as determined by the high-fidelity model.
The primary objective of this analysis is to ascertain whether the obtained temperature values demonstrate convergence towards a consistent value.
\Cref{fig:conv-output} illustrates the results of our mesh convergence study, clearly indicating a pattern of satisfactory convergence.
We select for further comparisons the values obtained for \texttt{M3} and for $\P_2$.

\subsubsection{Scalability}

In this section, we explore the scalability of our computational framework.
This involves measuring the time required to solve the model in relation to the number of MPI parallel processes utilized.
The time measured pertains to the duration necessary for assembling the algebraic system and solving the problem, as per \Cref{algo:hf}.
Our experiments utilized mesh \texttt{M3}, with both $\P_1$ and  $\P_2$ discretizations.
The results, presented in \Cref{fig:scalability}, demonstrate satisfactory scalability:
the execution time decreases as the number of parallel processes increases.
However, we observed that beyond 12 processes, the reduction in execution time becomes less significant.
Consequently, for optimal efficiency, we have selected 12 processes for our subsequent analyses.
This study sets the stage for a subsequent comparison with a reduced-order model, which employs a reduced basis with reliable, certified output bounds derived from the high-fidelity solutions.
This comparison aims to highlight that, while parallel computing can accelerate the high-fidelity computation, the reduced-order approach offers even more substantial computational gains.
